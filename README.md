# In-Vino-Veritas

We apply the nearest neighbor classiﬁer (sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassiﬁer) to a real wine quality dataset (adapted from the dataset hosted by UCI repository). The data records 11 chemical properties (e.g., the concentrations of sugar, citric acid, alcohol, pH etc.) of thousands of red wines from northern Portugal, as well as the quality of the wines, with “0” being “bad” and “1” being “good”. We intend to build a classiﬁer that can predict a wine’s quality (target) based on its chemical properties (features). Two data ﬁles are included: train.csv and test.csv. Both are of the same format: each line represents one kind of wine, with the ﬁrst 11 ﬁelds as its features and the last one as its quality. We will use train.csv to train the classiﬁer and test.csv to evaluate its performance.
